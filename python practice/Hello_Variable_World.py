# Hello Variable World

## Instructions

# Create two variables called `name` and `country` that will hold strings.
name = 'Jeremy'
country = 'USA'

# Create two variables called `age` and `hourly_wage` that will hold integers.
age = 20
hourly_wage = 10

# Create a variable called `satisfied` which will hold a boolean.

satisfied = True

# Create a variable called `daily_wage` that will hold the value of `hourly_wage` multiplied by 8.

daily_wage = hourly_wage * 8

# Use traditional string concatenation to print the `name`, `country`, `age`, and `hourly_wage` variables.

print(name,country,age,hourly_wage)

# With an `f-string`, print the `daily_wage` and `satisfied` variables.

print(f"{daily_wage} and {satisfied}")
