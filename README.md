# Election_Analysis

## Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections requests an audit on the results of a local election. Their voting data was captured in a CSV file named "election_results," and a Python program was used to analyze and write a report for the board to review. The program provides the following information:

* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout

and the results are communicated via the programs command line, as well as captured in a TXT file labeled "election_analysis."
